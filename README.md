# DigiWizard: A Modular Multi-Dev Tablet

This project aims to develop a tablet-like device based on the Raspberry Pi, featuring IR and RFID functionalities.

## Features

* IR communication ([VS1838B](https://www.sivago.com.cn/upload/pdf/2022/VS1838B.pdf))
* In-Built RFID Reader ([MFRC522 RFID Reader](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MFRC522.pdf))
* KDE-Plasma([plasma-mobile](https://plasma-mobile.org/get/))
* User-friendly interface

## Requirements
* **SBC:** Raspberry Pi 5 or any other Raspberry Pi
* **Display:** Waveshare 7" DSI (800x480) Touchscreen (DSI)
* **Cables & Connectors:** Official Raspberry Pi DSI cable

## Inital Setup
Go through [this](https://github.com/ppds07/digiwizard-pilet/blob/main/initial_setup.md) for the initial setup of the device.

## .conf Setup
Paste the .conf files at your own risk. These have the tendency to make the module stop working. All the configs are based on rpi-5 only. Due to the new RP-1 controller in the Raspberry Pi 5, the config commands may differ.
